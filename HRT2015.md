# O(1) query time, O(n) space reachability for planar graphs

This paper: reduce the case from acyclic single-source graph to an acyclic s-t graph (Section 3), and reduce the case of acyclic in-out graph to an acyclic single-source graph (Section 4).

## Acyclic single-source graph → s-t graph
In this section, we create a partition of the vertices of $G$ in the form of truncated $st$-graphs first. Then we use this decomposition to reduce reachability queries into the $st$-graph case.

### Part 1: st-decompositions
Create the st-decomposition of an acyclic single-source planar graph $G=(V,E)$, which is a rooted tree with nodes that correspond to truncated $st$-graphs (where we can add sources/sinks to obtain an $st$-graph without violating planarity). This will allow us to reduce to the $st$ case.

The *st-decomposition* is obtained by recursively choosing faces of $G$ wisely and letting all the vertices that can reach vertices on this face $f$ belong to this *st-decomposition* node. Then we partition all remaining vertices amongst the descendants of this *st-decomposition* node within the rooted tree. An *st-decomposition* looks something like below, where each edge in $G$ is in exactly one $C_x$, ie. *st*-node.

![IMG_01A82F88F64F-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/198895525-8593b6d7-0160-45a0-a45a-fd0e4f8942dd.jpeg)

We select faces of $G$ recursively such that the *st-decomposition* has height $O(\log{n})$ and each frame has an alternation number of 2 (this is called a good st-decomposition). This is done by selecting 'median' faces, i.e. those as close as possible to the middle.

**For given pair of vertices $u,v$, $u$ reaches $v$ in $G$ iff $u$ lies in a component of *st-decomposition* that is ancestral to $v$'s component.**

The reason for this is we choose the truncated $st$-graphs maximally such that once a path crosses a frame, it does not exit the frame into another one.

More formally, if $u$ reaches $v$ where $u \in C_x, v \in C_y$ (i.e. $C_x = bc(f_x) - S_y$ for $x$ child of $y$) then either $x=y$ (they are in the same st-decomp node) or $x$ has a child $z$ that is ancestor of $y$ such that any $u-to-v$ path contains some vertex in $F_z$. To see this, observe below:

![IMG_4BA98B02A86C-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/198897479-cc7efc12-213e-4db4-8612-b3ef874fa7d7.jpeg)

We know that the alternation number of any frame in an *st-decomposition* is at most 4, so between the frames of $u,v$ respectively there can be at most 4 best possible vertices that could reach $v$ within $u$ and $v$'s frame. So we use this level-ancestry system to find these candidate best vertices in the two frames. 

Once we can find these candidate vertices in constant time given our rooted tree structure, we have then reduced the single-source case into asking if any of these 4 candidate vertices reach the target vertex $v$ within a truncated st-graph (equivalence to the $st$-graph case).

In other words we have to check the following cases to answer reachable(u,v): given $u \in C_x, v \in C_y$ and let $\preccurlyeq$ be ancestry of st-nodes in the st-decomposition.

1. if $x \not \preccurlyeq y$ (x is not an ancestor of y$ then $u$ cannot reach $v$.
2. if $x = y$ then answer is given in the $st$-graph labelling of $C_x$ (see Tamassia, Tollis)
3. If $x \prec y$ and there are no 2-frames that separate $u,v$ but there are 4-frames. Then we can compute the at most 4 best vertices in $C_x$ that can reach $v$. If $u$ can reach any of them then $u$ reaches $v$, otherwise no.
4. Else $x \prec y$ and there is a 2-frame $F_z$ separating $u,v$ such that there are no 2-frames between $x,z$. Then we can compute the at most 2 best vertices in $C_z$ that can reach $v$. If $u$ can reach any of them, then $u$ can reach $v$ otherwise no.

### Part 2: constructing st-decompositions
Now that we've seen how the st-decomposition is helpful in answering reachability, we have to choose the faces of this st-decomposition carefully so it ends up having log-height.

In lemma 3.9 and 3.10, we show that first the faces of S (a subgraph of G where $S \cap T$ is connected) correspond to connected components of the dual spanning tree without edges in dual graph induced by $S$. Then we show that the subgraph of the cotree induced by the vertices in the dual graph including all faces contained in some st-decomposition node is a connected subtree. 

Specifically, 3.10 applies 3.9 to show that when considering children st-nodes, we actually consider connected components of the spanning tree. 3.9 wants to show that the faces of each subgraph whose intersection with T is connected correspond to the faces of the subtrees.

The idea of the proof of 3.9 is as follows: the easier direction is when the two faces are in different components of $G^*$, so it must be in different components of $T^*$ since a tree is 'less connected'. The other direction says that given faces in separate cotree components when considering a splitting face $x$, we can find a deleted edge of the cotree between the two faces (vertices in the dual) whose primal edge induces a cycle of the tree. This dual of this cycle then separates the two faces in the dual graph.

Then in 3.11 and 3.12 we show that all children nodes of 2 or 4-frames must also have alternation number of at most 4.

Then we can show that for any acyclic planar single-source graph, a good s-t decomposition exists.

![IMG_2CE42BA7B369-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/200659992-ce042308-e24e-4c8c-9c3b-f4a6eb0463a3.jpeg)

### Part 3: constructing a good *st-decomposition* in O(n)
Using prior work, we can improve the construction time of the st-decomposition by keeping track of the subtrees of $T'$, the cotree, and some information such that we can find $x$ (node of cotree) in $O(1)$ when $T'_x$ is a component at some point of the algorithm. 

Also for each node $x$ we keep the set of target vertices on $F_x$ (or $\emptyset$ if $x$ is root) and a face in $T'_x$ incident to the target each target in this set.

Then we build a $O(\log{n})$-height top tree over the cotree $T'$ and let $v'_{n-i}$ be the $i$th face that stops being a boundary during the construction (so boundary faces of a cluster are visited before boundary faces of their descendants), and we use this ordering to find splitting faces of the st-decomposition.

![IMG_EA78CB202D1E-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/200751190-d5c9f5ef-44d9-4916-bbea-2762dd657f97.jpeg)

Then for each $v'_i$ (a face in graph), we find the relevant node $x$ to split using connectivity structure. 

![IMG_2CA01EDF31A4-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/200751362-fffa426a-a6d5-49b3-bc98-1355aaee5c90.jpeg)

If $x$ is the root or a 2-frame then we just set $f_x = v'_i$. If $x$ is a 4-frame though we use a static nearest common ancestor data structure to find $f_x = \pi(v'_i)$, the projection of $v'_i$ onto the path between the faces incident to the target.

Then we traverse graph backwards from vertices of $f_x$ until we have all edges with destination in $C_x$ and delete these edges from the forest as we go along. Once done, take all targets in $C_x$ and select an incident face for each component it is incident to. If $f_x \neq$ $v'_i$ we try again with ${v'}_i$ now with deleted edges otherwise move onto the next face.

### Part 4: 2-frames
We want to learn about the relationship between 2-frames (while disregarding the 4-frames) first. We construct a 2-frame decomposition of the $st$-decomposition: a tree with nodes that are contracted subtrees (each node with a 4-frame is contracted with its nearest ancestor that has a 2-frame).

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be an st-decomposition of $G=(V,E)$. We define a *2-frame-decomposition* $\mathcal{T_2}$ by contracting each st-edge $(z,y) \in \mathcal{T}$ where the child $z$ of $y$ has a 4-frame. For each node $x \in \mathcal{T_2}$ that is contracted from a set of nodes $Y \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ we define $C_x:= \bigcup_{y \in Y} C_y$, and if $x$ is not the root we let $F_x:= F_{lca(Y)}, E_x:= E_{lca(Y)}$.

$E_x$ are the edges with tail on $F_x$. If $F_x$ is a 2-frame, it has a clockwise and anticlockwise disegment. We divide up the edges of a 2-frame into two sets of edges corresponding to left and right dipaths, $L_i, R_i$ respectively, from which $l_i(v), r_i(v)$ are the two best vertices that can reach $v$ on the node with same depth as $v$ itself.

![IMG_204CE947E716-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/199070311-7964b107-ad00-43bd-85d8-1ee983ed38bd.jpeg)

We order the sets of vertices in $L_i(v), \hat{L_i}(v), R_i(v), \hat{R_i}(v)$ by its starting vertex position on the disegments of $F_x$. For vertices $v \in V$ we create rooted trees $T_l, T_r$ with parent pointers $p_l, p_r$  that will allow us to compute these two 'best' vertices easily. We define $p_l[v] = l_{d_2[v]-1}(v)$ if $d_2[v] \neq 0$, else $\perp$. Similarly, $p_r[v] = r_{d_2[v]-1}(v)$ if $d_2[v] \neq 0$, else $\perp$. In other words, these parent pointers give us the best vertex in the corresponding dipath from the previous level.

Next define $l'_i(v), r'_i(v)$ as **nearest ancestors to v** in these rooted trees $T_l, T_r$ respectively, that have depth at most $i$.

Specifically, we let $l_i^{\prime}(v) = v$ if $v = \perp \vee d_2[v] \leq i$, else $l_i^{\prime}(v) = l_i^{'}(p_l[v])$ and $r^{'}_i(v) = v$ if $v = \perp \vee d_2[v] \leq i$, else $r^{'}_i(v) = r^{'}_i(p_r[v])$. Then we have $l', r'$ are $v$ themselves or invoke a recursive call to the left (right, respectively) parent pointer, which will eventually get to the $d_2[v] \leq i$ case or $v = \perp$ case.

We do not always have $l^{'}_i(v) = l_i(v), r^{\prime}_i(v) = r_i(v)$. In a 2-frame decomposition $\mathcal{T_2}$, when we have an $F_y$ parent frame of $F_x$ then we have two possibilities for the best vertices on $F_y$ given the best vertices on $F_x$, call them $l,r$:
1. Left parent of $l$ and right parent of $r$ are the best vertices for $F_y$
2. There exists a 'crossing', i.e. the left parent of $r$ is 'later' in the disegment ordering than the left parent of $l$, making a the best vertex (similar could happen with right parent of $r$). This case is illustrated below:

![IMG_A0EE2B637AA0-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/199115697-4e9b0937-a7df-4e25-9550-0131c81060bb.jpeg)

To see when 2. happens, we look at the crossing lemma. For $v \in V$, and $0 \leq i < d_2[v]-1$, if we have $l_i(v) \neq l_i^{\prime}(l_{i+1}(v))$, then $l_i(v) = l_i^{\prime}(m) \wedge r_i(v) = r_i^{\prime}(m) \wedge d_2[m] = i+1$, where $m = r_{i+1} (v) \neq \perp$. Similarly, $r_i(v) \neq r_i^{\prime}(r_{i+1}(v))$ implies $l_i(v) = l_i^{\prime}(m) \wedge r_i(v) = r_i^{\prime}(m) \wedge d_2[v]=i+1$, where $m = l_{i+1} (v) \neq \perp$.

If the nearest ancestor of $l_{i+1}(v)$ on the left dipath of vertices at depth $i$ is not the best vertex to $v$ at depth $i$, then there must exist a crossing vertex $m \in \{ r_{i+1}(v), l_{i+1}(v) \}$ such that the left and right parents of $m$ are the best vertices that can reach $v$ on level $i$. Intuitively, this is saying that a crossing must happen if the nearest parent at depth $i$ of the best vertex at level $i+1$ is worse (on depth i) than the best vertex at depth $i$ itself. Which means that the best vertex at depth $i$, $l_i(v)$, must go through a vertex on the right dipath (if it went through a vertex on the left dipath then that vertex must be $l_{i+1}(v)$) which we name $m = r_{i+1}(v)$.

So we define this $m_i(v)$ crossing vertex for $v \in $V$ and $0 \leq i < d_2[v]$ as this crossing vertex at level $i$ if it exists, else it is the nearest crossing vertex on a descendant level. 

In other words, $m_i(v):= v$ if $i+1 = d_2[v]$, $m_i(v) = l_{i+1}(v)$ of $i+1 < d_2[v]$ and $r_i(v) \neq r_{i}'((r_{i+1}(v))$, $m_i(v) = r_{i+1}(v)$ of $i+1 < d_2[v]$ and $r_i(v) \neq l_{i}'(l_{i+1}(v))$, and $m_i(v) = m_{i+1}(v)$ otherwise.

Then we can rewrite the $l_i(v), r_i(v)$ best vertices that can reach $v$ on level $i$ as $l_i(v) = l_{i}'(m_i(v))$ and $r_i(v) = r_{i}'(m_i(v))$. In other words, the candidate best vertices at depth $i$ to reach v are  the nearest ancestors of $m_i(v)$ on the left/right dipaths (this crossing vertex if it is at the right level, is the best last vertex on $l$ or $r$ on level $i+1$ depending on which crossing condition is satisfied, or the nearest crossing vertex in its descendant levels).

Then to calculate these values of $l_i(v), r_i(v)$ quickly given a value for $i$, we should store a bit array for each level and then find left and right ancestors for that crossing vertex. So to represent $m_i(v)$ as a function we use a rooted forst so we can use level ancestor structure on that forest to answer queries. Specifically, let M[v]:= { $i | 0 < i< d_2[v], m_{i-1}(v) \neq m_i(v)$ }, ie. the depths up to the 2-decomp. depth of $v$ where a crossing exists. We define parent pointers $p_m[v]:=m_{max M[v]-1}(v)$ if $M[v] \neq 0$, else $p_m[v]:= \perp$, with $T_m$ being the rooted forest with parent pointers $p_m[v]$.

The intuition is explained here:
![IMG_92A5C8EB06E9-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/199306627-a7023552-8ef7-4f4b-9369-cbd33590ba64.jpeg)

![IMG_5A7DD569E4FC-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/202502227-3724d48a-8550-4c68-93b1-cbb180bad4b6.jpeg)

Then the fast computation of $l_i, r_i$ exists by the following procedure. 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a planar acyclic single-source graph with good st-decomposition. For any vertex $v \in V$, let D_l[v]:= { $i | v$ has a proper ancestor $w \in T_l$ with $d_2[w]=i$ } and D_r[v]:= { $i | v$ has a proper ancestor $w \in T_r$ with $d_2[w]=i$ }. Store level ancestor structures (so we can find ancestors quickly) for $T_l, T_r, T_m$. Additionally, also store $d_2[v], D_l[v], D_r[v], M[v]$ for each vertex. Since this good st-decomposition has height $O(log n)$ we can represent $D_l[v], D_r[v], M[v]$ in $O(log n)$ bit words each. 

Using this representation, we find $d_2[m_i(v)] = succ(M[v]\cup \{d_2[v]\},i)$ (ie. the depth in 2-frame decomp. of the crossing vertex at depth i, which is the $i$th successor of $M[v]\cup \{d_2[v]\}$), this can be done in $O(1)$ time. Then we can use the level ancestor structure for $T_m$ to compute $m_i(v)$ in constant time by knowing its depth. Doing something similar, we can compute the depth of $l_i'(v)$ in $T_l$ in constant time, and compute the depth of $l_i'(v)$ in the whole st-decomposition in constant time using the level ancestor structure of $T_l$, and do the same for $r_i'(v)$. Given the functions for $l_i(v), r_i(v)$ that we can compute in constant time we also have computed both best vertices in constant time.

### Part 5: 4-frames
We have now seen how to find at most two best vertices on $F$ that can reach $v$ when $F$ is a 2-frame, so we are left with the case for 4-frames (particularly edges that do not cross a 2-frame, because otherwise we can use the earlier method to get from the nearest descendant 2-frame to a given level). If we have a 4-frame whose parent frame is also a 4-frame then we know they share a target vertex.

We number the source and target nodes in $F_x$, a 4-frame, $s_x^0, t_x^0, s_x^1, t_x^1$ in clockwise cyclic order, and if $F_y$, its parent frame, is also a 4-frame, there must be some $\alpha \in 0,1$ such that $t_x^\alpha = t_y^\alpha$. Additionally, we divide these into four disegments: $\mathcal{R^\alpha}$ if it is on the disegment between $s_x^\alpha, t_x^\alpha$, and $\mathcal{L^\alpha}$ if it is on the disegment between $s_x^{1-\alpha}, t_x^\alpha$.

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be an st-decomposition of $G$, then for any vertex $v \in V$ we want to store the st-node corresponding to $v$, ie. $c[v]$, the depth of this st-node, $d[v]$, and 
the set of st-node depths of 2-frame, non-root ancestors to the node $c[v]$ in $\mathcal{T}$, $J_2[v]$. We also store the maximum of such depths in $j_2[v]$ for easy accessing, since we want to know when we have 4-frames nested in 4-frames, which happens after the last 2-frame (ie, when depth is $j_2[v]$) so we will consider $j_2[v] \leq i < d[v]$.

Now given a vertex $v$ and a 4-frame $F$ that is ancestral to $v$, we will define the (at most) 4 best vertices that can reach $v$ (ie. one for each disegment of $F$) called $l_i^0(v), r_i^0(v), l_i^1(v), r_i^1(v)$.

For any depth of nested 4-frames, i.e. $j_2[v] \leq i < d[v]$ and $\alpha \in 0,1$, with $x$ being the ancestor of $c[v]$ at depth $i+1$, we define: $F_i(v)=F_x, E_i(v) = E_x \cap \mathcal{E_4}, L_i^\alpha (v) = E_x \cap \mathcal{L^\alpha}, R_i^\alpha (v) = E_x \cap \mathcal{R^\alpha}, \hat{L_i^\alpha}(v) = $ all edges (w,w') in $L^\alpha_i(v)$ such that w' can reach $v$. Similar with $\hat{R_i^\alpha}(v)$ except $(w,w') \in R_i^{\alpha}(v)$, and let $\hat{F_i}(v):= \hat{L_i^0}(v) \cup \hat{R_i^0}(v) \cup \hat{L_i^1}(v) \cup \hat{R_i^1}(v)$ and define $s_i^\alpha(v), t_i^\alpha(v)$ as the vertices associated with $s_x^\alpha, t_x^\alpha$. The at most four best vertices then are $l_i^\alpha(v) =$ last vertex in tail( $\hat{L_i^\alpha}(v)$) on the counterclockwise dipath of $F_x$ if $\hat{L_i^\alpha}(v) \neq \emptyset$, and $r_i^\alpha(v) =$ last vertex in tail( $\hat{R_i^\alpha}(v)$) on the counterclockwise dipath of $F_x$ if $\hat{R_i^\alpha}(v) \neq \emptyset$.

![IMG_0749170AE329-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/200912275-1eee6b76-28a8-400a-a4b7-1c411c2def6d.jpeg)

And let the sets $L_i^{\alpha}(v), \hat{L_i^{\alpha}}(v)$ be totally ordered on the counterclockwise order around each starting vertex, and let $R_i^{\alpha}(v), \hat{R_i^{\alpha}}(v)$ be totally ordered on the clockwise order. Similar to the 2-frame case, we define some rooted forests that allow us to compute related functions to the at most 4 best vertices, and introduce a crossing lemma that lets us use these functions to compute these vertices efficiently.

We define $T_l^\alpha, T_r^\alpha$ as rooted forests over $V$ with parent pointers $p_l^\alpha, p_r^\alpha$, which are defined as $p_l^\alpha[v] = l_{d[v]-1}^\alpha(v)$ if $d[v] > 0, F_{d[v]-1}(v)$ is a 4-frame, and $p_r^\alpha[v] = r_{d[v]-1}^\alpha(v)$ if $d[v] > 0, F_{d[v]-1}(v)$ is a 4-frame. In other words, these rooted forests represent vertices, with the parent of each vertex being the best possible vertex in that disegment in the previous level.

Then we define functions $l'^\alpha, r'^\alpha$ to compute $l^\alpha, r^\alpha$ efficiently for $v \in V \cup \perp$, $\alpha \in 0,1$, and $i \geq j_2[v]$: $l'^\alpha_i (v):= v$ if $v = \perp of $d[v] \leq i$, and $l'^\alpha_i(v) = l'^\alpha_i(p_l^\alpha[v])$ otherwise. Similarly, $4'^\alpha_i (v):= v$ if $v = \perp of $d[v] \leq i$, and $4'^\alpha_i(v) = 4'^\alpha_i(p_l^\alpha[v])$ otherwise. In other words, we set these functions to be the vertex itself if we are at $d[v]$ or deeper, or $v = \perp$, else we recursively call the function on its parent pointers.

*Crossing Lemma.* Let $v \in V, \alpha \in 0,1, j_2[v] \leq i < d[v]-1$. 

If $l_i^\alpha(v) \neq l'^\alpha_i(l_{i+1}^\alpha(v))$, then $l^\alpha_i(v) = l'^\alpha(m)$ and $r^\alpha_i(v) = r'^\alpha(m)$ and $d[m]=i+1$, where $m=r_{i+1}^\alpha (v)$.

If $r_i^\alpha(v) \neq r'^\alpha_i(l_{i+1}^\alpha(v))$, then $l^\alpha_i(v) = l'^\alpha(m)$ and $r^\alpha_i(v) = r'^\alpha(m)$ and $d[m]=i+1$, where $m=l_{i+1}^\alpha (v)$.

A visualisation of this crossing lemma is below:

**Technical Lemmas to prove Crossing Lemma**
![IMG_5A7DD569E4FC-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69584282/202358318-58e79737-6908-45e4-880f-cf1022980e98.jpeg)

**Proof of Crossing Lemma**


Then for any vertex v, $l_i^{'\alpha}(v)$ in V, \alpha=0,1, j_2[v] \leq i < d[v]: l_i^\alpha(v)=l_i^{'\alpha}(m_i^\alpha(v)), r_i^\alpha(v) =r_i^{'\alpha}(m_i^\alpha(v))$

We also define a rooted forest $T_m^\alpha$ over the vertices with parent pointers $p_m^\alpha$ that give us these 'crossing' vertices efficiently, with $p_m^\alpha = m^\alpha_{max M^\alpha[v] -1}(v), M^\alpha[v] \neq \emptyset$ where $M^\alpha[v]$ are the depths between $j_2[v], d[v]$ such that we do see a crossing (no case 4).

With these structures then we can answer the queries for $l^\alpha_i(v), r^\alpha_i(v)$ in constant time by using a good st-decomposition of $G$ with $O(n)$ words, each of $O(\log{n})$ bits. To do this we let $D_l^\alpha[v]:=$ { $i | v$ has a proper ancestor $w \in T_l^\alpha$ with $d[w]=i$}, $D_r^\alpha[v]:=$ { $i | v$ has a proper ancestor $w \in T_r^\alpha$ with $d[w]=i$}.

We store level ancestor structures for the rooted trees $T^\alpha_l, T^\alpha_r, T^\alpha_m$ and $d[v], j_2[v], J_2[v], D^\alpha_l[v], D^\alpha_r[v], M^\alpha[v]$ for each vertex, which we can store in at most $O(\log{n})$-bit words since the st-decomposition has height $O(\log{n})$.

Using this we find $d[m^\alpha_i(v)] = succ(M^\alpha[v] \cup d[v], i)$ and the depth of $m^\alpha_i(v)$ in $T^\alpha_m$ in constant time, which allows us to compute $m^\alpha_i(v)$ in constant time with the level ancestor structures. Then we compute the depth of $l_i^{'\alpha}(v)$ in $T^\alpha_i$ in constant time and computing the vertex $l_i^{'\alpha}(v)$ using its levelancestor structure in constant time. Similarly compute $r_i^{'\alpha}(v)$ in constant time using the levelancestor structure of $T_r^\alpha$ and the set $D_r^\alpha[v]$. Using these, we know that given constant-time finding for $l'^\alpha, r'^\alpha, m^\alpha$ we can find our at most four best vertices $l^\alpha, r^\alpha$ also in constant time.

## Acyclic Planar In-Out graphs → Acyclic Planar Single-source graphs 
An In-Out graph $G$ has a source vertex $s$ that can reach all vertices in the graph that have outdegree $0$. Given such a source we can assign colours to vertices: green if there exists a dipath that reaches it from $s$, and red otherwise. We can also colour the edges: if both endpoints have the same colour the edge is also that colour, and a blue edge if $(u,v)$ and u is red, v is green.

The idea for extending our single-source reachability oracle is to flip all non-green edges (so the In-Out graph becomes a single-source graph) and run queries on the modified graph, converting the answers to answers for $G$ (though this can't always be true in all cases). We need to endow the vertex with a few extra words:
1. A red vertex $u$ must remember the additional information of the best green vertices $BestGreen(u)$ on its own parent frame that it can reach (of which there are at most 4 such vertices, one for each disegment.
2. Information about paths from a red-to-green vertex in the same component.
3. Information about paths from a red vertex in one component $C$ to a green vertex in an ancestral component of $C$, 

Define $H$ to be this 'flipped' edge graph such that $G$ becomes single-source. Now we have four cases for $reach_G(u,v)$:
1. If $u$ green, $v$ red: $reach_G(u,v) =$ No.
2. For $u,v$ green: $reach_G(u,v) = reach_H(u,v)$
3. For $u,v$ red: $reach_G(u,v) = reach_H(v,u)$
4. If $u$ red, $v$ green: we need more work (it depends on the hierarchy of components of $u,v$.)

Specifically, when $u$ red and $v$ green we know that a $u$-to-$v$ path should consist of a (possibly trivial) red path, a blue edge, then a (possibly trivial) green path. Observe that in the st-decomposition of $H$, red and blue edges only stay within an st-node or go towards the root, whereas green edges can stay within an st-node or move to a descendant st-node. There are four cases to consider then, with $u$ red, $v$ green. This is shown below:

In the case of blue edges (consisting of a red vertex into a green vertex) in one st-node of the st-decomposition, we need to store additional information to check whether there exists a red-to-green path in the same node. We assign at most 2 numbers to each vertex, such that if the red vertex $u$ remembers $i,j \in \mathbb{N}$ and green vertex $v$ remembers $l,r \in \mathbb{N}$, then $u$ reaches $v$ iff $i \leq l \leq j$, $i \leq r \leq j$, min{l,r}$\leq j < i or $j < i \leq$ max{l,r}. Observe that we can enumerate all the blue edges $b_0,...,b_m$ made up of $(u_i,v_i)$ such that any red vertex can reach a segment of their endpoints, say $v_i,...,v_j$. These blue edges form a min-cut in the planar graph separating the red from the green vertices, which induces a cyclic order. Let $i,j$ be the first and last indices of the green vertices reachable from a red vertex $u$ through a blue edge, and let $l,r$ be the last indices of the latest blue endpoints $v_l, v_r$ on the delimiting path of the st-subgraph containing $v$ as the target.

Observe that if $u$ may reach $v$, it needs to do so via a vertex $w \in P \cup Q$, one of the two delimiting paths making up a face. So then $w$ must be able to reach $v_l$ or $v_r$, hence we know that $v_l$ or $v_r$ is in between $i,j$ or min{l,r} must be at most $j$ or max{l,r} must be at least $i$.

Now consider the case where a blue edge $(u',v)$ is separated by a frame $F_i(u)$, and $u'$ is reachable from $u$ but they are in different frames. Then one of the best vertices (ie. $l_i(u), r_i(u), l_i^\alpha(u), r_i^\alpha(u)$) must be a red vertex that can reach this $u'$. Letting $E_{c[w]}$ denote the edges of the parent frame of $w, F_{c[w]}$, we consider the set $B(w)$ of the blue edges in E_c[w]$ that is reachable from $w \in G$ (equivalently, can reach $w \in H$). 

For each disegment of $F_{c[w]}$ there exists at most one best edge of $B(w)$ (whose green head is closest to the source). If each red vertex remembers the best at most 4 blue edges it can reach on its own frame, then we can define 4 bitmasks such that for any $i$, finding the highest 1-bit of at most $i$ in each gives at most 4 levels such that $u$'s best vertices on those levels together know the best blue edges for $u$.
