# O(1) query time, O(n) space reachability for planar graphs

This paper: reduce the case from acyclic single-source graph to an acyclic s-t graph (Section 3), and reduce the case of acyclic in-out graph to an acyclic single-source graph (Section 4).

## Section 3: Acyclic single-source graph â†’ s-t graph
In this section, we create a partition of the vertices of $G$ in the form of truncated $st$-graphs first. Then we use this decomposition to reduce reachability queries into the $st$-graph case.

### Part 1: st-decompositions
Create the st-decomposition* of an acyclic single-source planar graph $G=(V,E)$, which is a rooted tree with nodes that correspond to truncated $st$-graphs (where we can add sources/sinks to obtain an $st$-graph without violating planarity). This will allow us to reduce to the $st$ case.

The *st-decomposition* is obtained by recursively choosing faces of $G$ wisely and letting all the vertices that can reach vertices on this face $f$ belong to this *st-decomposition* node. Then we partition all remaining vertices amongst the descendants of this *st-decomposition* node within the rooted tree. An *st-decomposition* looks something like below.

All vertices are represented in exactly one st-decomp. node (a frame), and we select truncated st-graphs maximally so once a path crosses a frame, it does not exit the frame.
We select faces of $G$ recursively such that the *st-decomposition* has height $O(\log{n})$ and each frame has an alternation number of 2 (this is called a good st-decomposition).

**For given pair of vertices $u,v$, $u$ reaches $v$ in $G$ iff $u$ lies in a component of *st-decomposition* that is ancestral to $v$'s component.**

The reason for this is we know that the alternation number of any frame in an *st-decomposition* is at most 4, so between the frames of $u,v$ respectively there can be at most 4 best possible vertices that could reach $v$ within $u$ and $v$'s frame. So we use this level-ancestry system to find these candidate best vertices in the two frames. 

Once we can find these candidate vertices in constant time given our rooted tree structure, we have then reduced the single-source case into asking if any of these 4 candidate vertices reach the target vertex $v$ within a truncated st-graph (equivalence to the $st$-graph case).

More formally, if $u$ reaches $v$ where $u \in C_x, v \in C_y$ (i.e. $C_x = bc(f_x) - S_y$ for $x$ child of $y$) then either $x=y$ (they are in the same st-decomp node) or $x$ has a child $z$ that is ancestor of $y$ such that any $u$-to-$v$ path contains some vertex in $F_z$. To see this, observe below:

In other words we have to check the following cases to answer reachable(u,v): given $u \in C_x, v \in C_y$ and let $\preccurlyeq$ be ancestry of st-nodes in the st-decomposition.

1. if $x \not \preccurlyeq y$ (x is not an ancestor of y$ then $u$ cannot reach $v$.
2. if $x = y$ then answer is given in the $st$-graph labelling of $C_x$ (see Tamassia, Tollis)
3. If $x \prec y$ and there are no 2-frames that separate $u,v$ but there are 4-frames. Then we can compute the at most 4 best vertices in $C_x$ that can reach $v$. If $u$ can reach any of them then $u$ reaches $v$, otherwise no.
4. Else $x \prec y$ and there is a 2-frame $F_z$ separating $u,v$ such that there are no 2-frames between $x,z$. Then we can compute the at most 2 best vertices in $C_z$ that can reach $v$. If $u$ can reach any of them, then $u$ can reach $v$ otherwise no.

### Part 2: constructing st-decompositions
Now that we've seen how the st-decomposition is helpful in answering reachability, we have to choose the faces of this st-decomposition carefully so it ends up having log-height.

In lemma 3.9 and 3.10, we show that first the faces of S (a subgraph of G where $S \cap T$ is connected) correspond to connected components of the dual spanning tree without edges in dual graph induced by $S$. Then we show that the subgraph of the cotree induced by the vertices in the dual graph including all faces contained in some st-decomposition node is a connected subtree. The intuition for these lemmas is below:

Then in 3.11 and 3.12 we show that all children nodes of 2 or 4-frames must also have alternation number of at most 4.

Then we can show that for any acyclic planar single-source graph, a good s-t decomposition exists.

The proof constructs a good st-decomposition by recursively selecting faces from root downwards.
- If x is the root, we let $f_x$ be the median of $T'$. (For each child y, $|T'_x| \leq \frac{1}{2}|T'_x|$ and since we have $S_x = bc(f_x)$, the children parent frames have alt. no. 2).
- If $F_x$ has alt. no. 2: let $f_x$ be the median of $T'_x$. (Like above, children y will have $F_y$ with at most half size and by 3.11, has alt no. $\leq$ 4).
- If $F_x$ has alt. no. 4: let $f_x$ be projection of the median of $T'_x$ on the path from faces incident to both local targets of $F_x$ (we pick face close to the targets) in $T'_x$. By 3.12 this means the alt. no. is at most 4 and we have halving in size as well.
