Goal: For planar graph G=(V,E), construct an O(1) query time, O(n) space reachability oracle.

This paper: reduce the case from acyclic single-source graph to an acyclic s-t graph (Section 3) and reduce the case of acyclic in-out graph to an acyclic single-source graph (Section 4).

Section 3: Acyclic single-source graph â†’ s-t graph
